WeatherApp is a modern Android application built with Jetpack Compose, MVVM architecture, and Clean Architecture principles. It provides real-time weather information for any city, including current weather conditions and a 7-day forecast. The app uses Hilt for dependency injection, Retrofit for network requests, and Room for local data caching.
